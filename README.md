# YOLOv11 Instance Segmentation for People Detection

![Cover Image](https://github.com/Brianhulela/yolo11_segmentation/blob/master/segment_cover.jpg)

This project demonstrates how to use the YOLOv11 instance segmentation model to detect and segment people in images. 

Follow this tutorial for a step-by-step guide on how to run the code:

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find the code and resources needed to perform the following tasks:

1. **Set Up a Python Environment**: Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Use the Ultralytics library to access the YOLOv11 model.
3. **Download a Test Image**: Retrieve an image from Unsplash for segmentation testing.
4. **Load the YOLOv11 Model**: Load the pre-trained YOLOv11 instance segmentation model for inference.
5. **Segment People in the Image**: Run the model on the test image and create a mask to isolate people.
6. **Visualize Segmentation Results**: Display the segmentation mask overlaid on the original image.
